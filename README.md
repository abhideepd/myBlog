Just to store written thoughts, whatever I am learning. Just for backtracking on what I learnt, in order to prevent "reinventing the wheel".
Sometimes I feel the urge to write, I write.

  <summary>my journey of building typemint</summary>
  <br>

  *update: while working on it, I realized, a lot of things, I don't need this. This was surprising. I realized, I touch type just casually, for context switching and relaxation purposes and I don't even really care or know, what I am typing, I just love the race and just do, while listening to music. And the last thing, I want is curated content, from twitter or whatever or analytics about which characters are causing me problems or which characters are my weak points. Whatever market size, this whole thing might have, I am just not connecting with this application anymore. Was a great learning experience though!*

  -- I love touch typing, not only, keeps me in practice, also, is a good stress reliever <br>
  -- love the typeracer interface, where i am competiting against somewith a car racing, and minimalist enough, i don't know, anything with car and fast is a good, animal brain i guess <br>
  -- however, i want to have control over what i am typing, like i want some twitter feeds, some humerious and laughing stuff, and also keep track of the words i am messing up and bring up those words as often as possible and also show me, which words and characters i am messing up on, basically, analytics of my choice. <br>

  <summary>my journey of building TicTacToc</summary>

  -- repo link: [https://github.com/abhideepd/Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/abhideepd/Tic-Tac-Toe) <br>
  -- three modes, computer vs computer, manual, against computer <br>
  -- no single users other than friends <br>
  -- learnt a lot about angular, deployemnt to remote repo and finally deploying to github pages. <br>
  -- specially, how to configure the build in order to deploy and angular application to github pages <br>
  -- learnt a lot about low level design patterns, when applying the undo-redo functionality, which, if we don't be conscious about, has a potential of spiraling the dependencies out of control. <br>

  <summary>Load Balancers</summary>

  ## Load Balancer

- such a cool name!! can be used in an email address or game names

- between the client and server, for the client, its the first point of contact. 
  - simply speaking, the client request, encounters the load balancer first before anything else.
- it distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers
- key to scalability

- below are the most important components of the load balancers.

# ___the below stuff writen, I need to explore more to get more clarity___


## Routing Algorithm
- this determines, how the load balancer distributes incoming request to the backend servers.
- common algorithms : 
  - Round Robin, rotates request evenly across all servers.
  - Least Connections, sends requests to the server with fewest connections
  - Routes based on the IP Address of the client. This ensures that the same IP gets the same server for each request.f

## Layers
- Layer in the OSI Model, the loadbalancer operates at. Loadbalancers can operate at different layers. Most common are Layer 4, the transport layer(TCP) and the layer 7(Application layer, http)
